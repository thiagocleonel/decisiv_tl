1 - Are you able to provide any suggested attributes based upon the decoding of the VIN given your newfound knowledge of this identifier?

A: Yeah, using the NHTSA API we could bring several info about the vehicle; besides make, model and year,
   we could also display number of engine cylinders, manufacturer or primary fuel type for example.
   The current solution gives an example of how it could work for VINs with valid check digits.


2- If we wanted to replicate or enhance behavior in our GET /vins/:vin endpoint in Global Assets how might this script help us? Do you see
any opportunities in the API contract to allow this when a consumer receives an HTTP 400 - Bad Request response.

A: The response's body could be changed to include the script's suggested VINs.
The logic and methods presents on the script could be easily placed on a model/service which would
be used on the API controller's action.
